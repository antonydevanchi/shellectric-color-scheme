# Shellectric Colorscheme

A retro-style dark colorscheme without eye-exploding contrast.
--------------------------------------------------------------

I've tweaked these colors throughout the years I've been looking at code/terminals and finally landed on something I haven't gone back to change. I have mild [synesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia), migraines that are most provoked by harsh light, and an obsessive compulse to over-design everything around me. For some reason these colors seem to work with all of that and look, in my "humble" opinion, rad.

I use these files in my osx/kde terminals and write in [vim](http://www.vim.org/download.php). My [dotfiles](https://github.com/fonsecapeter/dotfiles) and [custom font](https://github.com/fonsecapeter/peter_mono) leave me with what you see in the obligitory screenshot below. I just use a 16-color theme with vim to keep all my computing consistent and only define the color codes in one place (the terminal).
